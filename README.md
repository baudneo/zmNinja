homeProject Adoption 2022
-----------------------------------------
After 6+ years of developing zmNinja + ES + ML, [Pliable Pixels](https://github.com/pliablepixels) no longer had the time to maintain the project. ZoneMinder
development team will take on the support of zmNinja and provision of notification services going forward. This may necessitate
new app names due to some app store policies.

by many for home and commercial security monitoring.

Important Notes
---------------
* zmNinja needs APIs enabled in ZoneMinder. See [this](https://zmninja.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/validating-api.html) for instructions on how to make sure your APIs are working. If they are not working, zmNinja **will not** work.
